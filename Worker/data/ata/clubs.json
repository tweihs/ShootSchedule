Both roads work; the difference is more a matter of which entrance to the Club you are looking for. Action Pistol, Cowboy, Blackpowder,and Shotgun are closest via Hiwassee.","active_YN":"Y","address":"23787 Hiwasse RD","zip":"730007","lat":"35.6667233","lng":"-97.3267025","hours":"","trapFields":"2","skeetFields":"5","fiveStand":"Yes","sporting":"No","bunker":"No","archery":"Yes","zzBird":"","rifle":"Yes","pistol":"Yes","proShop":"","ammunition":"No","guns":"","creditCard":"No","lighted":"No"},{"gunClubNumber":"570155","gunclubName":"NORTH SHORE WINCHESTER PUBLIC SC","location":"FRANKSVILLE WI","state":"WI","country":"USA","webAddress":"","phone1":"","fax":"","drivingDirections":"NORTH ON I-94 EXIT 329 HWY K TURNLEFT UNDER HWY AND RIGHT ON W FRONTAGE RD","active_YN":"N","address":"3109 S 27TH ST","zip":"53126","lat":"42.7600616","lng":"-87.9130007","hours":"Tues - Fri 5-10 pm Sat & Sun 10-5","trapFields":"6","skeetFields":"6","fiveStand":"Yes","sporting":"Yes","bunker":"No","archery":"No","zzBird":"No","rifle":"No","pistol":"No","proShop":"Yes","ammunition":"Yes","guns":"Yes","creditCard":"Yes","lighted":"6"},{"gunClubNumber":"610017","gunclubName":"FALCON HILL GUN CLUB","location":"ABERDEENSHIRE SCOTLAND UK","state":"MC","country":"","webAddress":"","phone1":null,"fax":null,"drivingDirections":"","active_YN":"N","address":"","zip":"","lat":"57.6666979","lng":"-2.4970796","hours":"","trapFields":"","skeetFields":"","fiveStand":"","sporting":"","bunker":"","archery":"","zzBird":"","rifle":"","pistol":"","proShop":"","ammunition":"","guns":"","creditCard":"","lighted":""},{"gunClubNumber":"400214","gunclubName":"Morgan Co.
